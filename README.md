# Introduction 
This contains some basic function blocks for working with data and python. This is updated as and when functions are needed and is focussed around working with using dataframes and dictionaries in python. It currently works with data stored either as csvs or json files locally, or in an InfluxDB database. 

#Requirements
- python 3

# Build and Test
All functions are in the /src directory. 
To install the library use

# Limitations
- Further tests need to be written against pushing and pulling from Influx
- More functions needed to be added for working with different data files
- The Influx data pull and push can be further optimised
